**[Castle](https://castle.io) analyzes user behavior in web and mobile apps to stop fraud before it happens.**


## Usage

See the [documentation](https://docs.castle.io) for how to use this SDK with the Castle APIs

## Requirements

PHP 7.4 or newer, with the `curl` and `json` extensions. The library is tested
against PHP 7.4 through 8.4.

## Getting started

Install the latest version with Composer:

```bash
composer require castle/castle-php
```

Then load Composer's autoloader and configure the library with your Castle API
secret:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

Castle::setApiKey('YOUR_API_SECRET');
```

## Namespaces

As of 4.0 the library lives under the `Castle\` namespace, e.g. `Castle\Castle`,
`Castle\Webhook`, `Castle\RequestContext`, `Castle\ApiError`. This is the
canonical API:

```php
use Castle\Castle;
use Castle\Webhook;
use Castle\WebhookVerificationError;

Castle::setApiKey('YOUR_API_SECRET');

$verdict = Castle::filter([
  'request_token' => $requestToken,
  'name' => '$registration',
  'user' => ['id' => '1234'],
]);

try {
  Webhook::verify();
} catch (WebhookVerificationError $e) {
  // reject the request
}
```

### Backward compatibility

The historic global class names (`Castle`, `Castle_*`, `RestModel`) are kept as
aliases of their namespaced counterparts, so existing integrations keep working
without changes. `Castle_ApiError` and `Castle\ApiError` are the same class, so
`instanceof` checks and `catch` blocks work with either name:

```php
try {
  Castle::risk([/* ... */]);
} catch (Castle_ApiError $e) {
  // still catches the namespaced Castle\ApiError thrown by the library
}
```

New code should prefer the namespaced names; the global aliases are retained for
compatibility.

## Optional Configurations

Set preferred connection and request timeouts:
valid options for setting are:
- `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT`
- `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS`
- `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT`
- `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS`

```php
Castle::setCurlOpts($curlOpts)
```

Set a specified list of request headers to include with event context (optional, not recommended):
```php
Castle::setUseAllowlist($headers)
```

## Request context

By default, Castle extracts all the necessary information, such as IP and request
headers, from the PHP globals in order to build and send the requests to the
Castle API. However in some cases you want to track data to Castle from a context
where these globals are not available, eg. when tracking async in a background
worker. In this case you can build the request context manually.

### Origin IP Address
By default, the SDK extracts the contextual client IP address from headers in the following priority:
1. `X-Forwarded-For`
2. `X-Real-Ip`
3. `REMOTE_ADDR`

If the true client IP address is not specified in the above headers, you can manually set the IP address like so:

```php
Castle_RequestContext['ip'] = '1.1.1.1'
$context = Castle_RequestContext::extractJson();
```

## Lists

Manage [lists](https://docs.castle.io) and their items:

```php
$list = Castle::createList([
  'name' => 'Blocklist',
  'color' => '$red',
  'primary_field' => 'user.email',
]);

$lists = Castle::getAllLists();
$list  = Castle::getList($list['id']);
Castle::updateList($list['id'], ['name' => 'Renamed']);
Castle::deleteList($list['id']);
Castle::queryList(['filters' => [['field' => 'name', 'op' => '$eq', 'value' => 'Blocklist']]]);
```

List items:

```php
$item = Castle::createListItem($list['id'], [
  'author' => 'user:123',
  'primary_value' => 'user@example.com',
]);

Castle::getListItem($list['id'], $item['id']);
Castle::updateListItem($list['id'], $item['id'], ['comment' => 'Flagged for review']);
Castle::queryListItems($list['id'], ['filters' => []]);
Castle::countListItems($list['id'], ['filters' => []]);
Castle::archiveListItem($list['id'], $item['id']);
Castle::unarchiveListItem($list['id'], $item['id']);
Castle::createListItems($list['id'], ['items' => [/* ... */]]);
```

## Privacy

Request or delete the data Castle stores for a user:

```php
Castle::requestUserData([
  'identifier' => 'user@example.com',
  'identifier_type' => '$email',
]);

Castle::deleteUserData([
  'identifier' => 'user@example.com',
  'identifier_type' => '$email',
]);
```

## Webhooks

Verify the authenticity of incoming Castle webhooks. By default the raw body is
read from `php://input` and the signature from the `X-Castle-Signature` header:

```php
try {
  Castle_Webhook::verify();
  // handle the webhook payload
} catch (Castle_WebhookVerificationError $e) {
  http_response_code(404);
}
```

The body and signature can also be passed explicitly:

```php
Castle_Webhook::verify($rawBody, $signatureHeader);
```

## Errors
Whenever something unexpected happens, an [exception](lib/Castle/Errors.php) is thrown to indicate what went wrong.

| Name                             | Description     |
|:---------------------------------|:----------------|
| `Castle_Error`                  | A generic error |
| `Castle_RequestError`           | A request failed. Probably due to a network error |
| `Castle_ApiError`               | An unexpected error for the Castle API |
| `Castle_ConfigurationError`     | The Castle secret API key has not been set |
| `Castle_UnauthorizedError`      | Wrong Castle API secret key |
| `Castle_BadRequest`             | The request was invalid. For example if a challenge is created without the user having MFA enabled. |
| `Castle_ForbiddenError`         | The user has entered the wrong code too many times and a new challenge has to be requested. |
| `Castle_NotFoundError`          | The resource requestd was not found. For example if a session has been revoked. |
| `Castle_InvalidParametersError` | One or more of the supplied parameters are incorrect. Check the response for more information. |
| `Castle_InvalidRequestTokenError` | The request token parameter is missing or invalid |
| `Castle_WebhookVerificationError` | An incoming webhook could not be verified against the `X-Castle-Signature` header |

## Running test suite

Install the dev dependencies and run the suite with:

```bash
composer install
