# PHP SDK for Castle

**[Castle](https://castle.io) adds real-time monitoring of your authentication stack, instantly notifying you and your users on potential account hijacks.**

## Getting started

Obtain the latest version of the Castle PHP bindings with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/castle/castle-php
```

To get started, add the following to your PHP script:

```php
require_once("/path/to/castle-php/lib/Castle.php");
```
or

```php
require("/vendor/autoloader.php");
```
Configure the library with your Castle API secret.

```php
Castle\Castle::setApiKey('YOUR_API_SECRET');
```

## Include the JavaScript snippet

Before you add start using castle-php, make sure that you have included the Castle javascript snippet on every page in your app. See the [documentation](https://castle.io/docs/php/getting_started) for more information on how that's done.

## Tracking user behavior

`track` lets you record the security-related actions your users perform. The more actions you track, the more accurate Castle is in identifying fraudsters. We recommend that you at least track `$login.succeeded` and `$login.failed`:

**Track successful logins**
```php
Castle\Castle::track(array(
  'name' => '$login.succeeded',
  'user_id' => $user->id
));
```
> NOTE: `$user` refers to the currently logged in user.

**Track failed logins**
```php
Castle\Castle::track(array(
  'name' => '$login.failed',
  'details' => array(
    '$login' => 'johan@castle.io'
  )
));
```


### Supported events

Event names and detail properties that have semantic meaning are prefixed `$`, and we handle them in special ways. Here are all the events that Castle recognizes:

- `$login.succeeded`: Record when a user attempts to log in.
- `$login.failed`: Record when a user logs out.
- `$logout.succeeded`:  Record when a user logs out.
- `$registration.succeeded`: Capture account creation, both when a user signs up as well as when created manually by an administrator.
- `$registration.failed`: Record when an account failed to be created.
- `$challenge.requested`: Record when a user is prompted with additional verification, such as two-factor authentication or a captcha.
- `$challenge.succeeded`: Record when additional verification was successful.
- `$challenge.failed`: Record when additional verification failed.
- `$password_reset.requested`: An attempt was made to reset a userâ€™s password.
- `$password_reset.succeeded`: The user completed all of the steps in the password reset process and the password was successfully reset. Password resets **do not** required knowledge of the current password.
- `$password_reset.failed`: Use to record when a user failed to reset their password.
- `$password_change.succeeded`: Use to record when a user changed their password. This event is only logged when users change their **own** password.
- `$password_change.failed`:  Use to record when a user failed to change their password.

### Supported detail properties

- `$login`: The submitted email or username from when the user attempted to log in or reset their password. Useful when there is no `user_id` available.

## Errors
Whenever something unexpected happens, an exception is thrown to indicate what went wrong.
